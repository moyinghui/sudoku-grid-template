Writeup
1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?
The most challenging part was creating the Sudoku grids using only HTML and CSS without any JavaScript.
Designing the 9×9 and 6×6 grids to align perfectly using CSS Grid required careful control of borders and spacing.
Another challenge was making the navigation bar fixed and consistent across all pages while keeping it responsive.
2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile-friendly?
I used CSS @media queries to adjust layout and padding for smaller screens.
For iPhone 12 size, the navbar moves to the bottom of the screen so that the content area has more vertical space.
Text and buttons automatically scale using relative units like vw and clamp().
3. What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything you’re particularly proud of?
I aimed for a clean, modern dark theme inspired by puzzle apps.
I imported the Inter font from Google Fonts and used soft gradients with neon-style colors for visual contrast.
I am proud that every page looks consistent, and the Sudoku grid looks realistic even without JavaScript.
4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?
I would make the Sudoku grids interactive with validation logic, timers, and win detection using JavaScript.
I’d also like to add user profiles that track progress and display personal best times on the leaderboard.
5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
Around 8–10 hours in total, including design, HTML structure, CSS grid setup, and testing.
(Optional) Assumptions and references
No external code was used except for Google Fonts and CSS pseudo-elements.
All layout and styling were written manually using plain HTML and CSS.
